The reason for this is that it allows people to dress up in costumes and go to fun parties and events, but the ones that enjoy Halloween the most are usually the children. They will dress up and go out with their parents to ask for candy. Trick or treating has been the main way to celebrate Halloween for everyone in the US.

A candle is then placed inside of the pumpkin in order to give it a spooky glow that lights up the carved figures and can be seen from a long distance.

processing, make it necessary to delve into documentary analysis as a mediating process. The general objective of this study is to emphasize the linguistic and psychological dimensions of the mentioned process. The specific objectives seek to deepen and clarify its characteristic aspects, explain the
linguistic dimension of the mentioned process and its relation with the analysis of the
